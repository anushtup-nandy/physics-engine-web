# physics-engine-web
Web based multibody physics engine used to simulate robots over the web. Uses *Ammo.js* (JS port of bullet) and *Three.js*.

Goal is to make this into a plug and play website avoiding most if not all coding for users!

#### Demonstration:
- The layout of the GUI
![phy-eng-gui](https://github.com/anushtup-nandy/physics-engine-web/blob/main/pics/phy-eng-main.png?raw=true)

- Customizing the rigid bodies

## Currently done:
- [x] menu to spawn blocks and balls
- [x] simple grid like plane 
- [x] collision detection
- [x] Bouncing effect when objects are spawned
- [x] being able to move camera around
- [x] images to show block and ball
- [x] Drag around objects
- [x] Abstract block and ball code
- [x] Specify object dimensions
- [x] Abstract GUI interface (DEBUGGING - GUI does not come initially, for some reason it only comes after clicking on inspect)
- [ ] being able to spawn more complex objects (URDF)
- [ ] Improve sizing of the webpage
- [ ] Make the side-bar prettier
- [ ] Link GUI to all buttons
