# physics-engine-web
Web based multibody physics engine used to simulate robots over the web. Uses *Ammo.js* (JS port of bullet) and *Three.js*.

Goal is to make this into a plug and play website avoiding most if not all coding for users!

## Currently done:
- [x] menu to spawn blocks and balls
- [x] simple grid like plane 
- [x] collision detection
- [ ] Bouncing effect when objects are spawned
- [x] being able to move camera around
- [ ] images to show block and ball
- [x] Drag around objects
- [ ] Specify object dimensions
- [ ] being able to spawn more complex objects (for example rc car)

## How to use:
 *`git clone <ssh or https>` to get the repo locally
 * make changes
 * Then simply add-commit and push!
