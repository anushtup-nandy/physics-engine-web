# physics-engine-web
Web based multibody physics engine used to simulate robots over the web. Uses *Ammo.js* (JS port of bullet) and *Three.js*.

Goal is to make this into a plug and play website avoiding most if not all coding for users!

## How to use:
 *`git clone <ssh or https>` or 
 * create a pull request! (after creating a local repository)
